## titanic-dataset

Requirements
1. Python , jupyter notebook.
2. Numpy, Pandas, seaborn and sklearn library.
3. Dataset(titanic_dataset.csv), added in the repository.


This dataset has passenger information who boarded the Titanic along with other information like survival status, Class, Fare, and other variables. 
The unfortunate event which was occurred on 15 April 1912, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, aboard 2224 peoples. 

This project addresses the following Data Analysis topics:
1. Data Quality & Missing Value Assessment
2. Feature engineering
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Model Building

1. Data Quality & Missing Value Assessment
Checking the missing data:
 percent of missing "Age"
 percent of missing "Embarked"
 percent of missing "Cabin"
 
2. Feature engineering
Feature engineering refers to manipulation — addition, deletion, combination, mutation — of your data set to improve machine learning model training, leading to better performance and greater accuracy. Effective feature engineering is based on sound knowledge of the business problem and the available data sources.
  Missing value imputation
  

3. Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is used by data scientists to analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods.
    significant role to play in the survival
    Exploration of Fare
    Exploration of travelling alone variable
    Exploration of Gender Variable
    Correlation analysis for numerical variables

4. Model Building
    Using Logistic Regression algorithm for building model
    Examine the performance of model using various matrix

rest all presentation is on jupyter python file  [Titanic_analysis_and_Prediction.ipynb](https://github.com/rhythmbhavsar/Titanic-Analysis-and-Prediction/blob/master/Titanic_analysis_and_Prediction.ipynb)

sklearn is used for the machine learning algorithm(**Logistic Regression**) with score around 77.7%.
